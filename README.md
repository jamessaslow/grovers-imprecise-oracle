# An Error Analysis of Grover's Search Algorithm with a Faulty Oracle

<b> Return to [Full Project Portfolio](https://github.com/jamessaslow/portfolio) </b>

A quantum error correction project involving recovering the solutions to Grover's search algorithm with an imprecise oracle.


<h2> Grover's Search Algorithm <\h2>

In this research project, we obtain solutions to Grover's algorithm with an 'imprecise' Oracle while still maintaining the quantum advantage guaranteed by Grover's Algorithm. Grover's algorithm is a search algorithm that takes advantage of quantum superposition to perform a parallelized search in $O(\sqrt{t})$ times.
