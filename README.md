<b> Return to [Full Project Portfolio](https://github.com/jamessaslow/portfolio) </b>

A quantum error correction project involving recovering the solutions to Grover's search algorithm with an imprecise oracle.


<h2> Grover's Search Algorithm and Accuracy Issues at Large Qubit Sizes</h2>

In this research project, we obtain solutions to Grover's algorithm with an 'imprecise' Oracle while still maintaining the quantum advantage guaranteed by Grover's Algorithm. Grover's algorithm is a search algorithm that takes advantage of quantum superposition to perform a parallelized search in $O(\sqrt{t})$ times. Grover's Algorithm is structured by a two-step process: an oracle call followed by a Diffusion Operation. The Oracle call marks the desired item in the search with a pi-phase, and the Diffusion operator boosts the probability of measuring that marked item. In contrast to traditional Grover's search, we ...
